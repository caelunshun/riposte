Now they are ready to settle their first city.\n        \n    {}, lead your people to build a civilization that stands the test of time.\" \n \n You start with Hunting and Agriculture. Your special unit is the Jaguar Axeman due to the Jaguar Warriors in the Aztec Empire. The Jaguar Axeman replaces the Axeman. It costs 5 less hammers and does not require copper to build. This means that the Aztecs are good at creating a strong Axeman rush no matter the start to surprise opponents. Good Luck!, game.the_player().username()));\n"
