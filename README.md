# riposte
A clone of Civilization IV (2005). It is written from scratch (no game engine) and has, at various points in time, consisted of C++ or Lua code. Now, the whole implementation is in Rust. (Those rewrites were tedious but satisfying).

The graphics rendering uses [`dume`](https://github.com/caelunshun/dume), a 2D renderer I wrote on top of WebGPU, and the UI is based on [`duit`](https://github.com/caelunshun/duit), another one of my libraries.
